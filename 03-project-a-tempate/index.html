                <p>
                    Bees of the species Apis mellifera are found in various habitats around the world, including
                    forests, meadows, gardens, and agricultural areas. They can adapt to a wide range of environments
                    and are known for their ability to thrive in diverse climates.

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>
                    Apis mellifera, commonly known as the Western honey bee, has a distinctive appearance. It has a
                    compact and robust body covered in dense hair. The coloration of the bees can vary depending on the
                    subspecies, but they generally have a golden or brownish-yellow color with darker bands on their
                    abdomen. The workers are smaller in size compared to the queen bee.

            <p>
                Apis mellifera, or the Western honey bee, is one of the most well-studied and
                widely recognized bee species. It is native to Europe, Africa, and the Middle East,
                but due to human intervention, it has been introduced to other parts of the world as well.
                Apis mellifera bees are known for their complex social structure, efficient communication through
                dances,
                and their crucial role in pollination and honey production.

                How do we interact with this creature?
            </p>
            <p>
                Humans have interacted with Apis mellifera bees for thousands of years,
                primarily for their honey and other bee products like beeswax, propolis, and royal jelly.
                Beekeeping, also known as apiculture, involves the management and care of honey bee colonies
                to ensure their health and maximize honey production. Beekeepers provide hives for the bees,
                monitor their well-being, and harvest honey while taking measures to protect and support the colony.
